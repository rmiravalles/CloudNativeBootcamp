# Serverless in Azure and AWS

- There is always a server, but we aren't managing them.
- Before serverless, the only option was to run apps on a virtual machine. Then, you would still have to worry about the infrastructure.
- With serverless, you simply deploy your code.
- No more managing infrastructure.
- Focus on the code.
- Smaller footprint.
- Serverless is not just web frontend apps.
- Backend can also work serverless.
- **Scalability**
  - Auto-scaling
  - Much better performance

## Azure Functions

- Azure Functions are part of the serverless backend family.
- Azure Functions allow you to upload any type of backend code.
