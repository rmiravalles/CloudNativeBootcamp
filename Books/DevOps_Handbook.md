# The DEvOps Handbook

## Part 1

### Introduction

- DevOps and its resulting technical, architectural, and cultural practices represent a convergence of many philosophical and management movements.
- DevOps is the outcome of applying the most trusted principles from the domains of physical manufacturing and leadership to the IT value stream.
- While the foundation of DevOps can be seen as been derived from Lean, the Theory of Constraints, and the Toyota Kata movement, many also view DevOps as the logical continuation of the Agile software journey.

#### The Lean Movement

- Major tenets:
  - The manufacturing lead time required to convert raw materials into finished goods is the best predictor of quality, customer satisfaction, and employee happiness.
  - One of the best predictors of short lead time is small batch sizes of work.
- Systems thinking:
  - Constancy of purpose
  - Scientific thinking
  - flow and pull (versus push)
  - assuring quality at the source
  - leading with humility
  - respecting every individual
